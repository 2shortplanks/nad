For running nad, man nad.

These are the poor man's docs.

nad will run scripts from the config directory; only from that
and not subdirectories.  The best practice it to write your scripts
in subdirectories of the config dir and soft link to them to enable
their execution.

Some scripts distributed with nad need to be compiled (yes, they aren't
actually scripts, they are elf executables).  Since not all programs
can be compiled on all platforms, you need to go build them as needed.
There are makefiles, pick and choose.

If you write a set of scripts/programs, you can describe them in a
.index.json file and they will be reported on when you run nad -i.
